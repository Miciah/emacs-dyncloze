=dyncloze= is a simple emacs application to test yourself on confused alternatives, using the contents of an emacs buffer.

To use, load the library by placing it your =load-path=, and =(require 'dyncloze)=.  Then, fill a buffer with text in your target language, and use =M-x dyncloze=.  It will prompt you for words to test between, enter words separated by spaces.

For each word matches the words you entered, it will replace the word in the buffer with "[ ]", and then it will go through the buffer, top to bottom, asking you which word belongs in the space.

If you guess correctly, the word will appear in green, otherwise it will appear in red.  When you are done, you will receive a total.

This module also offers the ability to use regex's instead of words, meaning that you can test for patterns, such as word variants or ending patterns.  There are several examples given in companian modules, such as =dyncloze-es= and =dyncloze-pt=, where you can test for things such as "ser" vs. "estar", which will not only test for the infinite forms but other common forms as well.
