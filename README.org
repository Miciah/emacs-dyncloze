=dyncloze= is a simple emacs application to test yourself on confused alternatives, using the contents of an emacs buffer.

To use, load the library by placing it your =load-path=, and =(require 'dyncloze)=.  Then, fill a buffer with text in your target language, and use =M-x dyncloze=.  It will prompt you for words to test between, enter words separated by spaces.

For each word matches the words you entered, it will replace the word in the buffer with "[ ]", and then it will go through the buffer, top to bottom, asking you which word belongs in the space.

If you guess correctly, the word will appear in green, otherwise it will appear in red.  When you are done, you will receive a total.
